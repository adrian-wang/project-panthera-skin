 * <li>a filter (filter as defined in the previous page) <li>a logical relationship operator (i.e.
 * and/or/not) <li>a query (select... ­from... )<br>
 * FilterBlocks in the same QueryInfo scope forms a Tree structure.<br>

   * Nested Subqueries are transformed to inline view with various joins<br>

   * of outer/cross/inner join. Left Semi-joins are fine. Logical Relationships between Filters are
   * either absorbed or transformed to Set Operations <li>NOT: "not" operator is eliminated from the
   * tree using logical mathematics <li>OR: "or" operator is transformed to "UNION" operator with
   * consideration of _rowid <li>AND: "and" operator is transformed to "INTERSECT" operator with
   * consideration of _rowid Correlated Filters need special treatment according to semantics <li>
   * Most correlated filters find its positions in join conditions <li>Syntax Transformation Results
   * of Correlated Filters and Uncorrelated Filters are often different. E.g. ANY/SOME/ALL <li>We
   * don¡¯t support a nested query referencing columns other than its own source or its direct
   * parent¡¯s source (Only one-level up reference is allowed for correlated filters). The
   * Transformations are ordered <li>First, Unnest subqueries in Where conditions <li>Second, Unnest
   * subquries in select expressions <li>Third, Unest subqueries in Having conditions <li>Subquery
   * in select expressions does not coexist with groupBy/having clauses. Subquery in Having clause
   * need special treatment <li>Typically, unnesting subquery in where clause need only to change
   * FROM clause and WHERE condition<br>
   * E.g. select a, b from t1 where b in (select x from t2) ? select a, b from t1 left semi join
   * (select x as col1 from t2) subq1 on b = subq1.col1 <li>Unnesting subquery in having clause have
   * to be done after groupby is performed. So an enclosing query is needed for that.<br>
   * E.g. select a, sum(b) from t1 group by a having sum(b) in (select x from t2) ? select
   * subq2.col1, subq2.col2 from (select a as col1, sum(b) as col2 from t1 group by a) subq2 left
   * semi join (select x as col1 from t2) subq1 on subq2.col2 = subq1.col1<br>
